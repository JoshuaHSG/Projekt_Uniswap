#
#  Welcome to UniSwap ! 
#
#  Planning an exchange semester can be overwhelming and complex for students, as it demands a lot of time 
#  for Research and Organization, which many students don't have because amidst their already packed schedules 
#  and academic responsibilities.
#
#  This is where UniSwap comes in. UniSwap is the first overall University Exchange Information Portal that is 
#  designed to assist students in finding and organizing their exchange semester abroad. Its goal is to provide students
#  with all the information they need at their fingertips.
#
#  UniSwap provides a lot of interesting features that can help students: 
#
#  Features:
#  - Visualization of important deadlines and direct links to all the important StudentWeb pages 
#  - Dynamic and comprehensive searching and filtering options to browse for universities
#  - Detailed university profiles that including link to university website and testimonials, as well as additional information
#  - Interactive maps to visualize university locations.
#  - Integration of APIs for weather data.
#
#  The application is built using Streamlit, making it interactive and easy to navigate. To use streamlit, we had to learn about the 
#  streamlit documentation. We won't reference everytime we used the streamlit documentation in our code, due to the fact that we would
#  need to reference it for almost all the code you use. For this reason we will reference it now here: https://docs.streamlit.io
#  
#
#  Thank you for visiting our application and Enjoy your exploration!

#  1.) We start our source code, with all the important imports we need:

import streamlit as st                          # | We import the streamlit library to our Python environment under the alias st
import pandas as pd                             # | We import the pandas library to our Python environment under the alias pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta        # | We import the datetime and timedelta classes directly from the datetime module  -> https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
import requests                                 # | We import the requests library into our Python environment
import re                                       # | We import the re module (regular expression module) -> Chat GPT helped us here 


#  2.) We now define all small functions that run in the Backend of our application and that we later call in our main function


# a) This is the function for the Timer that we need for our Deadlines
# -> For this function we had help from various Websites: (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html, https://realpython.com/python-datetime, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-datetime-module)
#    They helped us learn more about the datime library 
def calculate_countdown(target_date):
   
    now = datetime.now()                                   #| We get the current datetime 
    countdown = target_date - now                          #| We Calculate the difference between the target date and now
    
    months = countdown.days // 30                          #| We extract the months, days, and hours from the countdown
    days = countdown.days % 30
    hours = countdown.seconds // 3600
    
    return f"{months} months, {days} days, {hours} hours"  #| # We return a formatted string, that shows how many months, days and hours remain until Deadline 



# b) This is a Function that generates HTML code for a styled button that acts as a hyperlink.
#    Streamlit abstracts much of the HTML/CSS away to simplify the process of turning data scripts into web apps. 
#    It has widgets for many common tasks but lacks the task for a hyperlink button, which is why we had to
#    create this function that does this. 
#
# -> For this function we had the help of ChatGPT, because we didn't know much about HTML code, especially not how to
#    use it to create a styled button that acts as a hyperlink.   

def create_button(link, text):
    button_style = """
    <a href="{}" target="_blank">
        <button style='
            color: white;
            background-color: #008CBA;
            padding: 10px 20px;
            text-align: center;
            display: inline-block;
            font-size: 16px;
            margin: 4px 2px;
            cursor: pointer;
            border: none;
            border-radius: 4px;
        '>{}</button>
    </a>""".format(link, text)
    return button_style



# c) This is our function that "visualizes" some of our Data.
#    We use our longitude and latitude data that we saved for every university in our csv to create a Google Maps Widget that shows the location of each university
#    We searched really hard and couldn't find any other way to display a Map directly into our streamlit application, which is why we used this method
#    -> However because we didn't learn about HTML code language yet we had the help of ChatGPT

#    This is our API Key for the Google Maps API we need for this Widget
API_KEY = 'AIzaSyCYSlwK_6UxkKN1cavKJh-HvEFj_M01jy4'            

def generate_map_html(latitude, longitude, api_key):
#| Our iframe code with placeholders for the API key, latitude, and longitude (The latitude and longitude information is saved in our csv). It returns an HTML string that represents an iframe containing the Google Map.
    return f"""
    <iframe
        width="600"
        height="450"
        frameborder="0" style="border:0"
        src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key={api_key}&q={latitude},{longitude}" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    """




#  3.) Now we introduce our Weather API


#  The API we use is the OpenWeather API.
#| This is our Open Weather API Key
API_KEY_weather = '1ae65478e4405591bd86c93b6526fc4e'                                     

def get_weather_data(latitude, longitude, API_KEY_weather):                            
    base_url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}&appid={API_KEY_weather}&units=metric"  #| (longitude & latitude get extracted from our csv). -> To correctly create the URL we had help from the the offical site of the OpenWeather API 
    response = requests.get(base_url)                                                                                                 #   ->https://openweathermap.org/api
    return response.json() 




#  4.) This is our function that is designed to load and clean a dataset from our CSV file with the help of the pandas library in Python



@st.cache_data                                              #| This decorator optimizes performance by storing the function's return value and only re-executing the function when its input parameters or the function's body changes
def load_data():                                            #| Our function load_data takes no parameters and is meant to perform data loading and cleaning operations
    data = pd.read_csv('streamlit_application_data.csv', delimiter=';')          #| We load data from a CSV file named streamlit_application_data. The delimiter ; indicates that the columns in the CSV are separated by semicolons
    

#| During our coding process we encountered many times an error, due to the fact that in some columns of our csv we had missing values and that their data types weren't consistent
#| Chat GPT helped us resolve this error by creating a cleaning process that looks like this 

    columns_to_clean = ['Continent', 'Country', 'Degree Level', 'Exchange Program']  #| We specify, which columns of the csv need cleaning

    for column in columns_to_clean:                                                  #|Â Our function then iterates over each column listed in columns_to_clean. For each column, it replaces missing values (NaN)                           
        data[column] = data[column].fillna('Unknown').astype(str)                    #| with the string 'Unknown' using fillna('Unknown') and converts the column to string type using astype(str).
                                                                                     #| this ensures that there are no missing values in the columns and that the data type is consistent
    return data


#| We now load our data into a variable
data = load_data() 


#| We also encountered the problem that sometimes one cell in our csv contained multiple entries, which caused an error that shut down our application
#| To prevent this error, we created a function that is designed to process all columns of our csv in which some cells contained multiple entries that were
#| seperated by slashes ('/').
 
def get_unique_list_from_slashed_column(data, column_name):

    all_entries = data[column_name].dropna().str.split('/')                             #| It first drops any NaN (missing) values from this column to avoid errors during splitting then splits each string in the column based on the '/' delimiter. This results in a list of lists, where each sublist contains the split elements of a row.
                                                                                        
    unique_entries = set(entry.strip() for sublist in all_entries for entry in sublist) #| We also strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each element and convert the list into a set, which hich automatically removes any duplicate entries because sets do not allow duplicates
    return list(unique_entries)

unique_degree_levels = get_unique_list_from_slashed_column(data, 'Degree Level')             #| We extract unique entries like "Bachelor/Master/PhD"  from the 'Degree Level' column from our "data" variable.  
unique_exchange_programs = get_unique_list_from_slashed_column(data, 'Exchange Program')     #| We extract unique entries like "Partner University/Freemover"  from the 'Exchange Program' column from our "data" variable. 

#| -> For the get_unique_list_from_slashed_column Function we had help with ChatGPT, because we didn't know how to solve the problem alone. 




#  5.) We now start setting up our sidebar in our streamit application


#   a) The function filter_data is designed to create the filter our csv data based multiple criteria: university name (via a search query), continent, country, academic level, and exchange program type.
#   -> We need this for setting up our filter bars 
def filter_data(data, continent_filter, country_filter, academic_level_filter, exchange_type_filter):

   #| If search_query is provided, it filters our csv data by checking if the 'Name of University' column contains the search query string. It is case-insensitive -> For this help of ChatGPT and ignores any NaN values -> For this help of ChatGPT.
    if search_query:                              
        data = data[data['Name of University'].str.contains(search_query, case=False, na=False)]

   #| If continent_filter is specified and is not 'All', it filters data (our csv data) by matching the 'Continent' column exactly with the value provided in continent_filter
    if continent_filter != 'All':
        data = data[data['Continent'] == continent_filter]

   #| If country_filter is specified and is not 'All', it filters data (our csv data) by the 'Country' column, looking for an exact match with the value in country_filter.
    if country_filter != 'All':
        data = data[data['Country'] == country_filter]

   #| If academic_level_filter is specified and is not 'All', it first converts the list of academic levels into a regular expression string by joining the list elements with the '|' symbol, which represents "or" in regex. 
   #  It then filters the data (our csv data) by the 'Degree Level' column, checking if any of the specified academic levels are present. This also uses a case-insensitive, regex-based search that ignores NaN values.
    if academic_level_filter != 'All':
        academic_level_filter_regex = '|'.join(academic_level_filter)  #| Here we had help with ChatGPT
        data = data[data['Degree Level'].str.contains(academic_level_filter_regex, case=False, na=False, regex=True)]

   #| We do the same that we did for academic_level also for the exhange_type data 
    if exchange_type_filter != 'All':
        exchange_type_filter_regex = '|'.join(exchange_type_filter)
        data = data[data['Exchange Program'].str.contains(exchange_type_filter_regex, case=False, na=False, regex=True)]

    return data


#   b) together with the filter_data function we also set up our Sidebars
with st.sidebar:

    # Continent Filter Bar  
    continent_filter = st.sidebar.selectbox(
        'Select Continent', 
        ['All'] + sorted(data['Continent'].unique())
    )
    
    #Country Filter bar 
    country_filter = st.sidebar.selectbox(
        'Select Country', 
        ['All'] + sorted(data['Country'].unique())
    )
 
    #Degree Filter bar
    academic_level_filter = st.sidebar.multiselect(
        'Select Degree Level', 
        ['All'] + sorted(unique_degree_levels)
    )

    #Exhange Program Filter bar 
    exchange_type_filter = st.sidebar.multiselect(
        'Select Exchange Program', 
        ['All'] + sorted(unique_exchange_programs)
    )
    
    #We also create our search bar 
    search_query = st.text_input("Search for a university")
    
    #All of the filtered date should be saved under a variable we call filtered data
    filtered_data = filter_data(data, continent_filter, country_filter, academic_level_filter, exchange_type_filter)


    #We also create a button for each university that is displayed below our sidebars
    for index, university in filtered_data.iterrows():
        
        #For each university we constructs a unique key for a Streamlit button. 
        #This unique key ensures that each button has a distinct identifier in the Streamlit interface
        unique_key = f'uni_button_{index}_{university["Degree Level"]}_{university["Term Dates"]}'       #|This key is formed using the string 'uni_button_', the row index, and specific attributes of the university such as "Degree Level" and "Term Dates" -> We had help from ChatGPT for this

        #When a user clicks on a button, the application captures and stores the detailed information of the selected university
        if st.button(university['Name of University'], key=unique_key):
            st.session_state.selected_university = university.to_dict()




# Now we set up the Main Layout of the Pop-Up, meaning the center page that appears when you click on a university on the sidebar


#   a) First we Initialize the session state for selected_university, in the case that it doesn't exist
if 'selected_university' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.selected_university = None


#   b) We create function to clear the page
def clear_session():                              
    for key in st.session_state.keys():           #| We iterate over all the keys (university selected) currently stored in Streamlit's session state.
        del st.session_state[key]                 #  and delete each key-value pair in the session state one by one


#   c) Now this is our Main Function for the Pop-Up Window


def display_university_details(university):

    #Main Title of each Pop-Up page, based on which university button was clicked
    st.title(f"{university['Name of University']} Details")

    for _ in range(2):                                                               #| We created a loop that creates blank space in the streamlit application. If we adjust the range we can create more or less blank space.
        st.write("")                                                                 #  We will repeat this loop many times, just to make the page more structured -> ChatGPT gave us the idea for this
